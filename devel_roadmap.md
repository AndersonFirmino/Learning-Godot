# Godot Roadmap

These are just tentative to have a rough idea of the development plan. Ideas and helping set better priorities are always welcome.

**Update (June 2014)** Some changes in the roadmap happened due to mostly our internal development schedule at Okam (features Juan needs to do for our games in course), basically 1.0 will have a few more features taken from 1.1 and will come out a little later.

### Godot 1.0 (stable) (~July/August 2014)

* Lightmapping
* More Shaders (Lighting & Post Processing)
* 2D Deforms and Skeletons
* Live Scene Editing
* Navmesh support
* Focus on Stability and Usability
* Complete Documentation (how much? time should tell)
* First stable, versioned release.
* Easier deployer for iOS and NaCL

### Godot 1.1 (~September-2014)

* Reflections (using reflection objects)
* Light Probes
* 2D Shaders
* FBX Import (ASSIMP? or blender did it..)
* Windows Universal Binary support (API should exist now?)

### Godot 1.2 (~December 2014)

* OpenGL ES 3.0 backend
* SSAO, LPV, and more modern visual effects.

### Future

* Add optional typing to GDScript
* Ideas?
