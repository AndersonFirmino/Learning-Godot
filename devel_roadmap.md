# Godot Roadmap

These are just tentative to have a rough idea of the development plan. Ideas and helping set better priorities are always welcome.

**Update (June 2014)** Some changes in the roadmap happened due to mostly our internal development schedule at Okam (features Juan needs to do for our games in course), basically 1.0 will have a few more features taken from 1.1 and will come out a little later.

**Update (September 2014)** Feature set was met for 1.0, currently focusing on stabilizing (fixing issues and pulls), and filling missing docs for a tentative end of the month release.


### Godot 1.0 (stable) (~September 2014)

* Lightmapping
* 2D Deforms and Skeletons
* More Shaders (Lighting)
* Navmesh support
* Focus on Stability and Usability
* Complete Documentation (how much? time should tell)
* First stable, versioned release.
* Easier deployer for iOS and NaCL

**Update (September 2014)** The goal with 1.0 is to have a version ready for initial promotion, stable release will likely attract more users, so it might be wise to wait a bit with new features and focus on more stabilization.

### Godot 1.1 (~December-2014)

* Live Scene Editing
* More Shaders (2D & Post Processing)
* Visual Shader Editor
* Support for Terrain 
* Reflections (using reflection probes)
* Rework UI (make panels little more customizable)
* Ragdoll Wizard/Helper (can be done manually now but it's a lot of work)
* OpenGEX or FBX Import (ASSIMP? or blender did it..)
* Windows Universal Binary support (API should exist now?)

### Godot 1.2 (2015)

* OpenGL ES 3.0 backend
* SSAO, LPV, and more modern visual effects. Let's put Unreal 4 and Cryengine to shame
* Better Networking Support.
* Improved Navmesh Support (Crowds)

### Future

* Add optional typing to GDScript
* Ideas?
