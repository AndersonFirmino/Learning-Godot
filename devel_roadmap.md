# Godot Roadmap

These are just tentative to have a rough idea of the development plan. Ideas and helping set better priorities are always welcome.

### Milestone 1 (~June 2014)

* No new features (unless small and useful)
* Focus on Stability and Usability
* Complete Documentation (how much? time should tell)
* First stable, versioned release.
* Easier deployer for iOS and NaCL

### Milestone 2 (~August-2014)

* Lightmapping
* Reflections (using reflection objects)
* Light Probes
* More Shaders (2D, Lighting, Post-Processing)
* 2D deforms and skeletons
* FBX Import (blender did it..)
* Live scene editing (should be rather easy)
* Navmesh support

### Milestone 3 (~November 2014)

* OpenGL ES 3.0 backend
* SSAO, LPV, and more modern visual effects.
* Windows Universal Binary support (API still does not exist AFAIK)

### Future

* Add optional typing to GDScript
* Make viewports more flexible
* Ideas?
