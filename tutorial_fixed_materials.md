# Fixed Materials

## Introduction

Fixed materials (originally Fixed Pipeline Materials) are the most common type of materials, using the most common material options found in 3D DCCs (such as Maya, 3DS Max or Blender). The big advantage of using them is that 3D artists are very familiar with this layout. They also allow to try out different things quickly without the need of writing shaders. Fixed Materials inherit from [Material](class_material), which also has several options. If you haven't read it before, reading the [Materials](tutorial_materials) tutorial is recommended.
