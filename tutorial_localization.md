# Internationalization

### Introduction

Ser√≠a excelente que el mundo hablara solo un idioma. Unfortunately for us developers, that is not the case. While not generally a big requirement when developing indie or niche games, it is also very common that games going into a more massive market require localization.

Godot offers many tools to make this process more straightforward, so this tutorial is more like a collection of tips and tricks.

Localization is usually done by specific studios hired for the job and, despite the huge amount of software and file formats available for this, the most common way to do localization to this day is still with spreadsheets. The process of creating the spreadsheets and importing them is already covered in the [Import Translations](import_translation) tutorial, so this one could be see more like a continuation.
