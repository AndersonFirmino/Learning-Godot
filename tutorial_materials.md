# Materials

## Introduction

Materials can be applied to most visible 3D objects, they basically are a description to how light reacts to that object. There are many types of materials, but the main ones are the [FixedMaterial](class_fixedmaterial) and [ShaderMaterial](class_shadermaterial). Tutorials for each of them exist [here (FixedMaterial)](tutorial_fixed_materials) and [here (ShaderMaterial)](tutorial_shader_materials). 
This tutorial is about the basic properties shared between them.
