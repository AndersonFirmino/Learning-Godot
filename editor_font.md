### Changing Fonts

Godot allows changing the font for the editor, and the font for the code editor. Both need to be in .fnt format, so they need to be imported somewhere using the [font import tool](import_font).

Then copy or do whathever you want with the font, as long as the location does not change, and set the relevant property in Editor Settings. Code editor font is refreshed automatically, but the editor needs to be restarted for the new global font to take effect.
