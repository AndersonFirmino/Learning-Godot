#Creating a Tilemap

### Introduction
Tilemaps are a simple and quick way to make 2D game levels. Basically, you start with bunch of reference tiles (or pieces) that can be put in a grid, as many times each as desired:

Collision can also be added to the tiles, allowing for both 2D side scroller or top down games.

###Making a Tileset

To begin with, a tileset needs to be made. Here are some tiles for it. They are all in the same image because artists will often prefer this. Having them as separate images also works too.

Create a new project and throw those inside.
